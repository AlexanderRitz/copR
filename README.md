### R package copR

An R package offering basic funcionality regarding Archimedean copulas.
Archimedean copulas can be constructed as an object based on the choice of a family like "Clayton". Random numbers based on the copula object can then be generated and contourplots of cdf and pdf can be used for visualisation of the constructed objects.
