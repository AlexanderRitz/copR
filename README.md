### R package copR

An R package offering basic funcionality regarding Archimedean copulas.
Archimedean copulas can be constructed as an object based on the choice of a 
family like "Clayton". Random numbers based on the copula object can then be 
generated and contourplots as well as perspective plots of cdf and pdf can be 
used for visualisation of the constructed objects.
The Log-likelihood function of copulas can be calculated and optimisation will 
result in the maximum likelihood estimator for the single parameter of the 
implemented families. Model selection criteria like AIC or BIC are implemented 
as well.
