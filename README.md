### R package copR

An R package offering basic funcionality regarding Archimedean copulas.
Archimedean copulas can be constructed as a generic "ArCop" object by supplying a supported family name like "Clayton". Random numbers based on the ArCop object can then be generated and contourplots of e.g. cdf and pdf can be used for visualisation of the constructed objects.
